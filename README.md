Feature engineering and linear algebra

# My, what big ~~teeth~~ features you have!

I recently completed an AI/ML course through VetsinTech with Michael Galarnyk. He stressed that the most important feature is feature engineering. The idea itself is easy enough to grasp. Just make more features. Ok, but what is it exactly? How does linear algebra come into play? Too often it seems learning all there is to know about AI/ML, it is put into various silo's when it comes to learning. Yes, there is linear algebra, calculus, python programming, statistics, probability, etc. But, what often occurs is not showing the inter-relationships between those things. Frustrating. At least for me. So, that what I hope to do here. Take a little slice of learning about machine learning, and show some relationships.
